* DONE complete tests in runtime_test.
* write test for validations
* enable tagged literal-based data dsl
** for classes as well as files
** specify rdf/edn files, rdf files, or functions that return data pervasively
* modernize error handling, use expound by default
* build, move to bitbucket, move to circleci 2
* merge to master

Disadvantage: extra consideration is needed to "rename" entities. Less
seamless interoperability with RDF. Need to do inferencing to support
using keywords in docs.

Alternative idea:
