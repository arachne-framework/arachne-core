** Requirements
*** fundamental storage of documentation is RDF, in Descriptor.
**** any RDF subject can be annotated with documentation.
*** text is structured (markdown?)
*** Any documentation can contain refer to other documentation, by way of its RDF subject
*** Documentation can be retrieved at REPL.
*** Documentation can be compiled to HTML/PDF/etc.
** Implementation

Documentation is written in markdown files, specifically CommonMark.

Documentation Subject will be delimited via HTML/CommonMark Processing Instructions.

Parsing will consist of scanning the classpath, loading any *.rdf.md
files, implementing the processing instructions, and inserting into
the given descriptor. This will be implemented in its own
"documentation" module.

Parsing may eventually also read *.clj source files, and extract docstrings.

Inline lookup is straightforward: the descriptor is queried, and the
explicit documentation is rendered alongside the textual docs.

Rendered documentation (can be deferred) is also straightforward:
Given some extra information about order and hierarchy, and some
filters (heuristics and explicit guidance), query the descriptor, parse the markdown, and
